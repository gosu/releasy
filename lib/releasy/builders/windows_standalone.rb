    # Creates a completely standalone Windows executable.
    #
    # @note Startup of the executable created by this build takes a couple of seconds longer than running from the other windows builds, as the files are extracted into a temporary directory each time it is run. It is recommended to build with _:windows_folder_ or _:windows_installer_ instead of this, unless you really need to distribute the application as a single file.
